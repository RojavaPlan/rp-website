	<h3>Learn the Kurdish Language</h3>

<p>The main languages spoken in Rojava are Arabic (most widely spoken), Kurdish (widely used) and Turkish. Without being able to speak one of these languages, you will be unable to work here effectively and only be given limited roles under supervision.</p>

<p>Learning Kurdish is far easier than Arabic, and you’ll be able to communicate with the majority of people you interact with. We suggest simply learning Kurdish which is widely understood.</p>

<p>To maximise your potential, we suggest that people who arrive here take the time to learn Kurdish. We offer an orientation course of 2 months. But before you arrive here, you can begin your preparations. The effort you put in will help you before you arrive, but don’t be put off by not seeing progress. The grammar you memorise will help towards picking up the language once you learn the words in Rojava.</p>

<p>First we recommend you bring a laptop which will enable you to work, read documents and so on. A tablet is less effective, but if you have one you can also bring it. An ebook reader is also a good idea if you plan to go to the war front as their battery lasts a long time.</p>

<p>You can right click these documents, and select “Save Link As…” to download them on your computer.</p>

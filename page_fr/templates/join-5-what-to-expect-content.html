    <p>This is a revolution. The movement that created it looks back on thousands of years of history that have amounted to the most progressive social experiment of our times. Don't expect things here to go your way. It is important to understand the culture and philosophy behind this new emerging society. Things here might be done differently from the way you're used to. Are you willing to learn a lot before you start doing things yourself? Are you ready to cooperate with people from many different cultures? Good! You can help a lot here!</p>

	<h3>What To Expect</h3>

<p>Rojava is in a very historic moment in time. It is a symbol which we can point to and show the success of a federated localized society. There is a lot of pluralism and efforts to value women, religion, other languages and equality between ethnic groups. Revolutionary change is not percieved primarily as an outside process but as change of one self. Gender liberation is not achieved by "giving women more rights", but by criticising and ultimately changing what we percieve to be the roles "men" and "women". Women's liberation here means also the liberation of men. People are very open to outsiders with new ideas and this is a revolution being made by people of all backgrounds and types. That’s not to say there aren’t big problems we face. This is not the revolutionary disneyland that some media sources proclaim. However, with the help of the right analysis and historical view these difficulties can be overcome. This process itself is the revolution. This is as real as it gets, and this is a new world full of opportunity.</p>

<p>Life is generally communal. A key aspect is the collective assembly, or tekmil, in which everyone sits down together and shares criticism and self-criticism with the group in a respectful manner. It is the basic institution for solving day-to-day problems and enabling people to take up responsibilities as part of a group. While by working we are changing the world around us, in tekmil we face our own problems, misunderstandings and fears. This is where democratic confederalism starts.</p>

<p>Due to the difficulties bringing people over we can only accept people that are willing to stay for at least six months. To properly learn the language and be able to make a contribution here you should aim for a longer stay though, ideally a year or longer</p>

<p>You will spend at least a month learning the language and about Rojava before doing anything. You may well be working alongside different ethnical, political, ideological, and religious people and expected to adapt and integrate. You will be expected to help out with any and all chores.</p>

<p>There is a YPG academy for foreign volunteers with a one month course covering language, Rojava's history, philosophy and culture, and basic military training. Structures to support revolutionary volunteers in civil society here in Rojava are currently under construction. Planned is a two-month course on history, culture and the philosophy of the Rojava revolution, including a comprehensive language course. Once we have updates on the situation we will publish them here.</p>

<p>Regardless of mandatory courses we expect all volunteers to put effort into learning the language and adapting to the circumstances.</p>

<p>We do advise specialists to bring tools they need for work as these might be difficult to procure in Rojava (lab equipment, range finders or camera lenses as examples).</p>

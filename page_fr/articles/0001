For the revolution and the fight against ISIS to continue, solutions MUST be found to the embargo which is dramatically limiting vital resources. Rojava is now facing famine. But we have a Plan.

For the revolution and the fight against ISIS to continue, solutions MUST be found to the embargo which is dramatically limiting vital resources. Rojava now depends solely on its own production of food, but this relies heavily on chemical fertilizer which hasn't been available since the embargo began. Rojava is now facing famine.

To address this problem we are building facilities to produce organic fertilizer on a large scale, which we will distribute to local farmers and cooperatives. This model will then be replicated across Rojava.

Not only does this solve the food problem, but it also promotes an ecological ideology, and allows Rojava to continue its disengagement with capitalism, and to build its self-sufficiency by no longer relying on trade with states that refuse to recognize its autonomy and newly announced federation.

Rojava needs YOUR help, NOW!

	<h3>I'm Ready To Come</h3>

<div class="notice">
<h4>Look, the KRG (Kurdistan Regional Government) has enacted a total embargo against Rojava which makes it impossible to bring anybody over the border at the moment.</h4>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The border with Bakur (Turkish-occupied Kurdistan) is also not an option because of the war going on there.</h4>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>We are making a list of all the people who want to come. You can still apply but we don't know how long it will be before we can bring people over again. This is a war and it's impossible to plan in advance.</h4>

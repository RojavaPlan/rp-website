Deriya is a 19 year old YPJ fighter, I met in a base close to Serikaniye, 20km from the front line. She is from a muslim family like many of her comrades. For her going to war is first to protect her people but also a way to break away from the traditional role of women who stay at home. At the base, she was learning to write Kurdish as well as the principles of democratic confederalism.

The Newroz camp close to Derik hosts around 600 Yezidi families. Most of them come from Shengal which was attacked by IS last year. The thing about this camp is that people from Derik help to build it and still help the refugees with their basic needs.

These young women participate in a sewing workshop. In the Newroz camp there are many activites for the youth to learn, to earn a bit of money or even just to do something. When I was there, there was a sewing workshop, a school for children, music and theater activities. People told me that a garden project was proposed at the beginning of the camp. It wasn't accepted by the people living in the camp because they see the camp as temporary, and they will grow food back in their homeland.

In Rojava, like all middle eastern countries, take off their shoes when they enter houses. Whether for hygiene or religious reasons, everybody regardless of religion or ethnicity follows this culture. Here we are at the law and justice academy in Qamishlo.

This is a shop keeper in Serekaniye. There are many small shops in Rojava where they sell a bit of everything like food, sweets, soap, batteries... kind of like off-licenses in England. Mostly they stay open until 7 or 8 pm, but there is opening house rules in Rojava.

Serekaniye bus stop for Qamishlo. The buses take around 15 people. They leave when enough people arrive. The trip costs 300 Syrian pounds which is roughly 1 US dollar.

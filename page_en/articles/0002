<p><strong>Anarchism, once a powerful movement is now in sharp decline. Although the ideals are prospering in new sister movements, the symbols and language of anarchism are declining. Rojava is a good lesson for anarchists.</strong></p>
<p>Today the political power of anarchism as a driver for substantiative change that impacts the lives of people is very small. It is a movement that has turned in on itself, surviving within its niche inside capitalist states.</p>
<p>The movement has become overly concerned with the idea of simply promoting ideas and lifestyles without any substantive action or plan behind it. Any sense of coordination or organization has been broken by petty squabbling and infighting, overly concerned with division rather than understanding.</p>
<p>Rojava has a program. It's not perfect, but it's a plan. The plan is a banner or rallying call for people to move towards and injects a vision into the society that people can work behind. In the simplest level it works by common people (the driver, the soldier, the worker) blindly chanting allegiance to their leader Ocalan. But from there it leads down a path towards a system that is aimed at decentralizing power and promoting the voice and agency of individuals.</p>
<p>A revolution emerged because enough of the population supported this program which is led by a vanguard party that is ideologically motivated. In turn they educate and promote their ideals among the people and move towards empowering citizens to govern themselves.</p>
<h3>A Society Emerging Out Of Oppression</h3>
<p>Under Assad, the people of Rojava had no voice and were suppressed. This has bred a mindset in people of keeping their head down, and an understanding of the world based on blind loyalty to leaders.  Very few people understand what freedom is, and instead see the west as everything ideal.</p>
<p>The main concerns of people living in Rojava is not women's liberation, ecology or democracy. It is having good schools, electricity and nice cars or mobile phones. These are the common concerns of people.</p>
<p>If tomorrow, the citizens in Rojava could vote, they would probably elect a faction of Barzani. Democracy is not just about voting. It is a culture of an open society and this is the bigger goal to work towards.</p>
<p>Unfortunately many people think that Iraqi Kurdistan and Erbil are examples of a good society because <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/may/05/kurdistan-next-dubai-iraq">big western corporations, skyscrapers and an abundance of consumer goods exist</a>. The citizens of Rojava want that, and manage to excuse Barzan's authoritarian behaviour or his support of Erdogan against fellow Kurds.</p>

<p>So would we want to dissolve power now into the hands of these people, who would simply create another state? Or is it more complicated than that?</p>
<p>Anarchists have a good philosophy about empowerment and freedom. A way that people could govern together and manage their lives in a federation of local regions aiming to put decision making power at the hands of localities.</p>
<p>But it seems there isn't a program for how we can develop and run this society. A program that answers questions and deals with the problems such as how to limit the exploiting of the environment by digging wells, how to deal with trash disposal, and how to bring women into public spheres of life, among many other questions.</p>
<p>Among the first groups to show solidarity and come to Rojava, are the communists. They have even fought and are active in the society. And where are the anarchists? At home, comfy in the west.</p>
<p>Right now, anarchists are gripped by self obsession rather than any sense of vision. There's a nihilism that nothing can be done, and a petty inwards looking lifestylism. The biggest results of which can be seen in the lack of solidarity with Rojava from anarchists. Yet from Chiapas to Rojava, the world is changing and we must start engaging on a global level.</p>
<p>This is a revolution based on the ideals of local democracy, women's empowerment, cooperative economy and political pluralism. We have the chance to realize our ideas and take part in a big experiment that's never happened before. Do you want to make this happen?</p>

<p>The next wars will not be fought over gold or oil, but over much more basic resources. Especially in the Middle East.</p>

<p>While natural reservoirs of petrol and gas continue to be contested among the many groups currently fighting in Syria, Turkey, and Iraq, control over water and arable land has become much more important.</p>

<p>Daesh realized this long ago and established its caliphate by conquering large swaths of land along the two great rivers of Mesopotamia.</p>

<p>They confidently control more than 1000 kilometers of the Euphrates, from Jarablus at the Syrian-Turkish border to Ramadi in the heart of Iraq, as well as portions of the Tigris. The Syrian regime lost Raqqa and Der ez-Zor a long time ago, and Tikrit on the banks of Tigris was only retaken after a five-month campaign with heavy losses on the side of the attackers.</p>

<p>Water has become an important source of power (both electrical and political) in recent decades. In 2013, Egypt almost declared war on Ethiopia over building a dam on the Blue Nile that threatened Egypt's water security. Control over the springs of Euphrates and Tigris is a major source of conflict between Turkey and Syria as well as the Kurds who inhabit this area.</p>

<p>It is the Kurds, in alliance with Arabs, Assyrians, and other minorities of the region, who have put up by far the most noteworthy resistance against Daesh. Their armed forces, the YPG and QSD, have not only broken the Jihadist's siege on KobanÃª but also expelled Daesh and Al-Nusra from most of northern Syria and pushed south until the suburbs of Der ez-Zor and Raqqa.</p>

<p>The territory they control, between the Euphrates and Tigris, is known as Rojava. The other sides of those rivers are in the hands of Daesh and Turkey respectively, both forces hostile to Rojava.</p>

<p>The Turkish regime has cut off many of the streams that run from the Kurdish mountains into the Mesopotamian basin, seriously limiting Rojava's water supply and threatening the delicate ecological balance of the whole area.</p>

<p>The Khabur, Rojava's third largest river, is completely dry and some quarters of Qamishlo, Rojava's most populous city, has no water for days. While in the south, the desertification of once arable land is advancing scientists are warning of a <a href="http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/climate-change-contributes-worst-drought-middle-east-over-900-years-487878483" target="_blank">historic drought</a> in the Middle East.</p>

<p>Rojava's land is very fertile and produces more than enough to feed their four million people, but the large wheat monocultures that make up more than 90 percent of Rojava's agriculture depend heavily on chemical fertilizer. Due to the embargo imposed by Turkey, less than 10 percent of the needed amount of fertilizer came across the border this year. Rojava's farmers will only be able to harvest one third of the usual crop.</p>

<p>Beyond the frontlines of an escalating conflict, Rojava is at the stage of a social revolution. Its main principles are democracy, women's freedom, and ecology.</p>

<p>The ecological approach is now vital for creating Rojava's economy. By taking the <a href="http://www.dw.com/en/syrian-kurds-take-strategic-dam-from-islamic-state/a-18943392" target="_blank">Tishreen dam</a> in the Euphrates Rojava has made an important step away from dependence on fossil fuels and ill-equipped refineries. But the only safe future for Rojava's water, energy, and agriculture lies in decentralization.</p>

<p>Fertilizer needs to be produced locally from organic waste. Solar energy technology needs to be advanced. Euphrates and Tigris must supply Rojava with the needed water.</p>

<p>Rojava and the promise of its cultural and political freedoms has become a safe haven for hundreds of thousands of refugees. But economic insecurity is driving people to attempt the hazardous journey to Europe. If Rojava had enough water and food, nobody would be forced to leave and people could actually start returning to their homeland.</p>

<p>Daesh is taking its war to Europe, as the attacks in Paris and Brussels have shown. Iraq and Syria's armies tend to lose against the Jihadists, and the terror group maintains a strong network of agents across Turkey. Rojava is literally the only democratic force standing between the caliphate and Europe.</p>

<p>If Europeans want to stop Daesh, they need to support Rojava.</p>

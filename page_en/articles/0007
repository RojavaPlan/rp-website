<p><strong>Our accounts have been closed on YouTube for making videos about Rojava's society.</strong></p>

<p>According to the emails below, our accounts have been excessively flagged
as inappropriate. Our account has been closed after undergoing
a review by YouTube for violating their community guidelines.
YouTube refuses to reinstate our account after reviewing our appeal.</p>

<p>The account had 3 videos uploaded. The video which triggered this violation was our video on sport activities in Rojava.</p>

<p>Before the email on Dec 16 notifying us our account had been closed, we never received any other email from YouTube. No warnings. Nothing. See our inbox <a href="${data_prefix}pics/allemails.png">here</a>.</p>

<p>Here are links to the videos and their YouTube URLs.</p>

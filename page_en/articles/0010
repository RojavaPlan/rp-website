<p><strong>Member for the presidency ministry, Salih El-Nebwani, who is now in Geneva, revealed that until now the MSD was not invited to talks for the Geneva-3 meeting where discussion for the Syrian peace process was taking place.</strong></p>

<p>The MSD is a collection of opposition groups including groups from Rojava, and the political wing for the newly formed <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Democratic_Forces">SDF</a>. It aims to unite opposition groups around a democratic federalized Syria.</p>

<p>El-Nebwani communicated that for the preparation of the list of opposition groups in Syria, he met with special envoy <a target="_blank" href="https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=48244#.U-cf4aNhvq4/"><strong>Steffan de Mistura</strong></a>.</p>

<p>El-Nebwani announced that for the exchange and solving of the Syrian crisis, the MSD met with lots of European states and have established multiple links with international groups.</p>

<h3>“For the Geneva meeting, a national delegate will be established”</h3>

<p>About the meeting with De Mistura, El-Nebwani gave this information: “In the meeting, we will forward our proposal for the preparation of negotiations between multiple sides. We will propose that a delegate for national negotiations representating the MSD and outside that can be sent to join the Geneva-3 negotiations.”</p>

<h3>“We will spread the Self-Administration to the whole of Syria”</h3>

<p>We asked whether they would propose the Democratic Self-Administration in the Geneva congress. El-Nebwani answered: “In the Geneva negotiations, he will search for a solution to the Syria crisis. The Democratic Self-Administration is a successful experience. We will make efforts that this experience becomes noted in the meeting and becomes spread to the all of Syria.”</p>

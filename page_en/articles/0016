<p>Our <a src="https://coopfunding.net/en/campaigns/feed-the-revolution" target="_blank">Feed The Revolution campaign</a> is now coming to an end, with only two days left. We have now collected over 85,000 euros from almost 600 backers in just 6 weeks. Although we are far from our original goal, we are very happy and consider this a great success.</p>

<p>One of our main reasons for reaching out the the international community was to develop solidarity towards Rojava in a direct way, and at the same time to inform those, for whom Rojava is relatively unknown, about how the revolution here is providing solutions for a new Syria based on democratic confederalism through social, political, and ecological ideas and practice. We are radical in our philosophy, and more importantly in our practice, and we wish this revolution to go far beyond any borders.</p>

<p>In this way, we uphold strong solidarity with all people of the world and at the same time are grateful that the world is increasing its solidarity with Rojava.</p>

<p>The project has been written about hundreds of times in the media, by established journalists and even more so by activists who so passionately worked to promote the campaign. We have received contributions to Feed The Revolution from revolutionaries all around the world, including libertarian political writer Janet Biehl, the great hacker <a src="https://twitter.com/GammaGroupPR" target="_blank">Phineas Phisher</a>, as well as countless Rojava solidarity movements and radical left political groups.</p>

<p>Although we can't mention all of them, we are particularly moved by the small donations of 20, 10, or even 5 euros, because they come from humble people who probably needed the money but chose to use it for a revolutionary purpose. All our respect to them!</p>

<p>We have already started building the facility and begun the teacher training process. During the campaign, this project has come to be well known in Rojava and we have been offered a lot of support from people and institutions. This means that we will be able to go forward with the plan despite not receiving all the funds that we asked for. Any donations in these last two days of the campaign are going to make sure that no time will be lost waiting for alternative equipment or materials, meaning that we can buy everything immediately, and the project can start the day the campaign ends.</p>

<p>For this project we are using only our own tools to fix and make the equipment needed. This is proof of the things that can be done in a decentralized, self-managed way without the need for states or private companies.</p>

<p>We are proud to say that none of this campaign has relied on capitalist companies such as Indiegogo or Paypal. The crowdfunding platform, <strong>Coopfunding</strong>, is a small cooperative run by activists which takes no fees at all, as is <strong>Betabank</strong>, the place where we keep our euros. We received almost half of our donations in <strong>cryptocurrency</strong>, which means no banks were involved. We want to encourage everyone to use this kind of cooperative economy tools.</p>

<p>Thanks to all of you, we will finally be able to put our grain of sand towards building a revolutionary, self-sufficient, and sustainable society in the Middle East, and to support the global struggle against fascism.</p>

<p>Bij√Æ Rojava!</p>

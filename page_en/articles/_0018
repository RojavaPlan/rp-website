<p>Qamişlo</p>

<p>Dear Judith</p>

<p>it's been a long time since I last wrote to you. Unfortunately it's always when the most interesting stuff is happening, that you do not find the time to write it down.</p>

<p>Spring has arrived in Rojava. The long, cold nights are over and everything is bright green, the wheat fields, vegetable patches and the the newly planted fruit trees; and the rape flowers, poppies wild rucola blossom in white, yellow and red. Newroz has passed with storms and heavy rains, but now it is dry and sunny.</p>

<p>I am still staying in Qamişlo most of the time. For several weeks now heavy fighting is going on in Nisêbîn on the Turkish side of the border. It is so weird: Here I hear chickens, birds singing, kids playing and the occasional motorcycle from outside the window, but every couple of minutes there are massive explosions that make the glass shake, and when I go to the roof I see the smoke rising up. The AKP regime is bombing the cities of Bakûr to rubble with heavy artillery. Cizîre and Sûr look like Gaza in Summer 2013. Did European media report anything on it? I just saw that they spoke about the bombings in Ankara and Istanbul. The one in Ankara by TAK was on Turkish Airforce pilots, so I can't say I'm too sorry about that. They've been bombing villages and guerrilla camps in Bakûr and Başûr for over eight months now.</p>

<p>The YPS are putting up a good resistance in Nisêbîn. It's funny to watch the news first on a movement channel - “Six AKP Special Forces killed and one Armored Vehicle destroyed, while one YPS fighter fell Şehîd (Martyr)” - and then on an AKP channel - “One policeman fell şehîd today in hospital despite emergency medical measures. Ten terrorists killed.”</p>

<p>When I drive on the ring road I pass by the border, just about a hundred meters from the Turkish Army, the wall that they are building, and our fighting comrades. It's a disgusting feeling to be so close yet do nothing. We have more than enough enemies on our side of the border.</p>

</p>Sometimes they mortar across the border. The market was hit by a shell once but luckily it was on a Friday so nobody was hurt.</p>

<p>Qamişlo is a real patchwork of a city. You have the Kurdish quarters, like Enterî and Heleliye, where the colors of the revolution, of YPG and YPJ fly on every roof, or Qenatê Suez, where the reactionaries raise the Başûr flag. You see the red banners of the Arab Shammar tribe in the south, the blue-yellow-red Assyrian flag in the center and the Baath flag on the roadblocks of the Regime between the market and the stadium.</p>

<p>I don't know if there's any secular Arab opposition that's not part of the Autonomy, I believe they've all degraded into Islamism. Of course there's also Jihadist Kurds and Arabs here, but they don't show their flags as openly as the rest.</p>

<p>I will write more another time, but it's getting dark, and I still want to get back to Derbesiye tonight. I'll answer the other questions next time. And, seeing as my letters apparently don’t reach you anymore, I'll publish this one as a blog.</p>

<p>From Mesopotamia with love,</p>

<p>Lewend</p>

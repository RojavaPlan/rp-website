Many refugees leaves their homes in search of a western dream fueled by television propaganda. We must stop pushing a false narrative and be realistic.

<p><strong>A Kurdish friend relates a story that before the war, his best friend joined IS and they still talk over the internet regularly trying to convince the other that they are confused. His friend just left for Germany to study engineering. Skills he plans to bring back to IS after completing his study.</strong></p>

<p>Rojava is a wake up call for what the refugee crisis really is. While we should strive to create a free and open world where people can travel without constraint, we must also keep a clear view of the entire picture.</p>

<p>Once we let everybody in, then what's our plan for them? Once in Europe, the solidarity is gone. There are still homeless people and social problems in our own societies.</p>

<p>Far from their family and trapped in a materialistic world driven by consumption and vanity, their fate is to have a downtrodden life, probably worse than in their own country. They're basically destined to be our slaves. Maybe deep inside that's what we want.</p>

<p>In western society we secure ourselves through insurance and social security systems. While in the middle east, they opted for social inter-dependence, family wealth and health support.</p>

<p>Community plays a role in people's lives and village elders gather to resolve disputes. This system fits the lifestyle here where the administration just lacks the efficient bureaucracy. Things are cheap and families range from 7 to 15 children.</p>

<p>When those families come to Europe, they expect they will enjoy the same network of support, together with state money.</p>

<p>But what actually happens is they are put into refugee camps with poor living standards, or are given a flat and minimum wage that they maintain through heavy paper work.</p>

<p>In both cases, they are tied to the system. If they do not collaborate or obey what the state says, then they have no recourse and nobody will help them.</p>

<p>The state behind a generous socialist face just wants cheap workers and an obedient population. At the first misstep the refugees take, they will be sent back.</p>

<p>Refugees themselves are driven by capitalist propaganda to come to Europe but are not interested in participating in the society. They want to enjoy their own culture but with the comfort of life sold to them through decades of mass media.</p>

<p>A small proportion of refugees come from the real war zones in Syria. They leave their homes, but mostly just across the border into Turkey waiting to return. Some leave to Europe.</p>

<p>But the majority of refugees come from areas in Syria where their lives are not in huge danger. They want to profit from the now open borders. The war is an excuse so they can reach Europe in search of the western dream.</p>

<h3>Millions Leaving Rojava for the European Dream</h3>

<p>Compared to one year ago, the streets of Rojava are now empty and it is a serious problem for the society here that all the young people are leaving. No hope of a future career and a lack of faith is driving people to leave rather than build around them.</p>

<p>We should understand that since birth, many of the youth here have been bombarded with messages that their society is shit and western society is heaven. Most people here when seeing a westerner will say they want to come back to Europe with them.</p>

<p>They have no idea what they will do there. They say they will be "runishtim" - which means sitting down. Except for a few youth that want to study, the others have very little ambition and no will to give input to the society they will live in.</p>

<p>They don't understand this. They think they are going to a wonderful place to have a lifestyle they see in the movies. They are risking their lives for a mirage, a great lie. For the latest iPhone and a nice car.</p>

<p>For each new group of immigrants arriving in Europe, a new nazi is born and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/14/paris-terror-attacks-fn-far-right-le-pen-front-national?CMP=share_btn_tw">sectarian hatred is fanned</a>.</p>

<h3>Syria's Secret Revolution</h3>

<p>Real refugees fleeing danger are already welcomed in Rojava and safe here. In fact, many are coming here. But nobody is talking about this.</p>

<p>Conscious people stay in Rojava. They stay and struggle for their rights. Many foreigners have even taken the opposite journey. Coming to Rojava is not heroic or exceptional; it's a basic act of conscience.</p>

<p>While in Syria there's war, in Rojava there's a full-on revolution challenging the assumptions for how we construct society. But it is getting very little attention.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the European government is supporting terrorist states like Turkey. It acts against internet neutrality while <a target="_blank" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/what-is-ttip-and-six-reasons-why-the-answer-should-scare-you-9779688.html">creating the TTIP</a>. It bails out banks and evicts families from their homes. All while drafting legislation supporting corporations that <a target="_blank" href="http://phys.org/news/2015-11-eu-cancer-popular-weedkiller.html">endanger our health</a>.</p>

<p>Europe is turning into an enemy of democracy.</p>

<p>We tried and lost. The social revolution in the west has ended.</p>

<p>But in Rojava, they are doing it. That's why we're telling people to come to Rojava. And we must spread its message. "Later" might be too late.</p>

There's a water shortage in Rojava but it does not have to be that way if we learn how to use it wisely. We also must look into decentralized solutions that can be deployed locally.

<p><strong>There is enough water for everyone in Rojava, if we learn to use it wisely. The Rojavan self-administration has a strong environmental awareness, and is doing great efforts to improve the situation, but outside help is greatly needed.</strong></p>
<p>A friend relates a story of his time in a military commune.</p>
<p>They had two big tanks: one of drinking water, another one of non-potable water. For several days they kept using the drinking water tank for cleaning the floor, watering the plants and that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Then the tank ran out. They realized they had no water for drinking, and the unit ran into a crisis.</p>
<p>In Rojava this basic commodity is free (someone else pays for it). They pour huge amounts of it onto the streets. They carelessly pollute large masses of underground water with oil. When there's a leak (something quite common) they can take months before fixing it.</p>
<p>I've seen them using hundreds of liters to clean a building that was already clean in Qami≈ülo, while several blocks away families were having severe shortages, with just a couple of hours of running water a day, if any at all.</p>
<p>Every extra liter you use is one less litter for someone else, but that connection hasn't been made yet in the minds of Kurds.</p>
<h3>Alternative Decentralized Solutions</h3>
<p>But human behaviour is not the only cause of water problems in Rojava.</p>
<p>In Cezire canton there are three main rivers, as well as six lakes in the north. In terms of water resources it used to be a very rich area. Now the rivers are dry, polluted, and literally filled with rubbish.</p>

<p>The uncontrolled development of irrigated cultivation in semi-arid areas and digging of new wells overburdened groundwater sources.</p>
<p>Power outages are still a regular occurrence, so water is still not consistently available. Sometimes electricity only runs for a few hours a day.</p>
<p>There is at least one water purification plant, but its technology is outdated and there's nobody here with the knowledge to maintain it. Industrial and mechanical engineers are desperately needed in Rojava.</p>
<p>Many thousands of people have emigrated from Rojava in the last years. If there are water problems, will Rojava manage to continue?</p>
<p>While we wait for the engineers to show up, and for the embargo to be lifted, part of the solution might have to do (once more) with decentralization. A house with a 100 m<sup>2</sup> roof can collect 45,000 L of rain per year, more than enough for the drinking water necessities of an average family.</p>
<p>Once the drinking issue is solved, the rest of the water doesn't need to be potabilised, therefore saving a lot of effort, chemicals, and energy.</p>
<p>We need people to help implement these policies and teach families how to do it properly. This is an opportunity to pioneer new methods of living in a country with support from the administration.</p>

<p>Is art the fuel that keeps the fire of the Kurdish resistance alive?</p>

<p>Art at war times always carry strong messages. In Rojava it's not only a political statement or a form release from facing really tough times. It's about taking back your identity in your hands.</p>

<p>Before 2011, to have a book written in Kurdish or to sing traditional songs in the street could easily lead you to prison and torture.</p>

<p>Since Kurds have gained greater autonomy in northern Syria, their mother tongue can at last be heard in the streets, the new school books are written in Kurmanji and art and cultural centers are thriving in every city.</p>

<p>This short docu is an introduction to the creative mind of Rojava's artists and an attempt to grasp the essence of their inspiration.</p>

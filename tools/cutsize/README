Copy the images to input/ and then run the script.
Make sure the files are descriptive and properly named
(not just 001343.JPG but bus-stop-amuda.jpg)

  $ python cutsize.py

banner: wide images used in normal articles, especially at
the top of the page.

thumbnail: small box shaped images used in the side of articles.

img: like banner but more square and taller.

normal: size isn't changed but the file is renamed according
to the proper naming scheme. This is used for galleries.

* Galleries will use img for the pictures in the article,
and normal for the images once clicked.
